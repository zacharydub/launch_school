  <h1>Hello, internet!</h1>
  <p> Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong> HTML</strong> &amp; <strong>CSS </strong>from a
    <strong><em>terrific</strong></em> class I'm taking at
    <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a> I'm learning a lot! Why don't you
    join me?

  <p class='second'>There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &
    CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color
    than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS
    will help accomplish that.

  <p class='second' id='last'> This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an
    `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the
    entire paragraph.</p>
