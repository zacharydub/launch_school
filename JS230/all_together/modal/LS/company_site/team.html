    });
//In the team.html file, we added a <div> for the modal layer and a <div> for the modal itself; the both begin with a class of hide. The modal <div> contains the empty <img>, <h3>, <p> elements which will be populated dynamically, as well an <a> element which will have an event listener attached for closing the modal.

//We added CSS rules to style the #modal-layer and #modal divs, as well as the content of the modal. The show and hide classes will be added and removed from the #modal and #modal-layer dynamically in order to change their visibility and opacity; the #modal has a transition property set to create a fade effect.
//
//Our JavaScript code in modal.js is fairly basic in terms of implementation. We have a DOMContentLoaded event listener, within which we use querySelector and querySelectorAll to locate the various elements we need to manipulate and then assign variables to those elements.
//
//We declare two functions showModal() and hideModal() which do fairly similar things:
//
//The showModal() function uses the Element.closest() method to locate the closest matching anchor (<a>) element to the event target. The reason for using closest is so that we know we are always working with the <a> element, regardless of whether that element or one of its children was clicked. The function then sets the content for <h3> and <p> elements of the modal, and the values of the src and alt attributes of the <img> element. They are set to the values of the appropriate data- attributes from the <a> element that was clicked. Finally, the Element.classList.replace() method to remove the hide class from the modal and modal layer, and add the show class.
//The hideModal() function essentially does the reverse. It empties the <h3> and <p> elements of the modal, as well as the values of the src and alt attributes of the <img> element. It then removes the show class from the modal and modal layer, and adds the hide class.
//Finally we have four event listeners:
//
//There is a click event listener attached to each of the list items. We could have delegated the listener to the <ul> element rather than attaching them individually, but this would have required some additional conditional checking in response to every click within the <ul> to see if an <li> element or one of its children was actually clicked. Since there are only four <li> elements, attaching a listener to each isn't really an issue in terms of performance. The handler for this event is the showModal() function.
//There are click event listeners for the #modal-layer div and the close anchor element of the modal, which both call the hideModal() function.
//Finally there is a keyup listener which calls hideModal() if the Escape key is pressed.
