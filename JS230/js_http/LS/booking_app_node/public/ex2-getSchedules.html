    //Implement a function that retrieves all the schedules that are available. If one or more schedules are available, tally the count of schedules for each staff and alert the user of result as "key: value" pairs with the staff id as key (in the format of 'staff {id}'; e.g, 'staff 1') and the count of schedules as the value. If there are no schedules, alert the user that there are currently no schedules available for booking.
    //When implementing the function, keep in mind that server has been known to slow down when there are more than 7 schedules to retrieve. It doesn't always happen, but be sure to handle it accordingly. Once 5 seconds have passed, cancel the retrieval and inform the user to try again.
    //Finally, inform the user about the completion of the request regardless of the success or failure (timeout) of the request.

            if (!staffs.includes(key)) {
              staffs.push(key);
              tally.push(1);
            } else {
              tally[staffs.indexOf(key)]++
            }
          })

          alert(tally.map((_, index) => `${staffs[index]}: ${tally[index]}`).join('\n'));
          //console.log(tally.map((_, index) => `${staffs[index]}: ${tally[index]}`).join('\n'));

        } else {

        alert('Taking longer than usual, please try again later.')
      })
      xhr.addEventListener('loadend', () => {
        alert('The request is finished.')
        //console.log(('The request is finished.'))

      })
      xhr.send();
    }
//With regards to the XMLHttpRequest for retrieving the schedules there are two things to note. First, for the possible long wait time, you must set the timeout property of the request object. Next, you must have a listener for the loadend event. Recall that this listener will fire regardless if a timeout or load event occurs.
//The next thing is the tallying of schedules per staff. For this one, the solution uses two arrays: one to track the unique staff (via their IDs) and another to track the count of schedules for each staff. The solution then iterates over the schedules and checks, for every iteration, if the staff is already part of the staffs array. If it isn't, the staff is added to staffs and in the corresponding index position for the tally array, the value is set to 1. If the staff is part of the staffs array, the index of the staff is looked up and used to increment by 1 the corresponding element for the tally array.
//Further Exploration
//An alternative approach for getting the tally is to use the /schedules/:staff_id route. Rather than iteratively counting the schedule for each staff, you can just get the length of the value returned.
