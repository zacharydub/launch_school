//Sequence (when clcking on the box, then typing two letters, then clicking on box):
//1- The click event listener listening on the bubbling phase on the div#elem1 element that alerts the tagName of the target element (the second event handler).
//2- The keypress event listener listening on the bubbling phase on document that alerts the code of the keyboard key that was pressed (the first event handler).
//3- The keypress event listener listening on the bubbling phase on document that alerts the code of the keyboard key that was pressed (the first event handler).
//4- The click event listener listening on the bubbling phase on the div#elem1 element that alerts the tagName of the target element (the second event handler).
//In a later assignment, we'll cover the concept that this practice problem surfaces â€” the event loop. For now, just note that events queue and it's the oldest one that gets processed first regardless of the type of event.
