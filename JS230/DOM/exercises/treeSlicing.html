<!--Implement a function, sliceTree, that is "similar" to the Array.prototype.slice method, but this time for a DOM tree. The sliceTree function takes two arguments: the start index which is the parent node's id attribute and, the end index which is the innermost child node's id attribute. The function returns an array of tagNames. Take note of the following when implementing the sliceTree function:

    - It's similar to slice but different in the sense that slice isn't inclusive on the right hand side.
    - The end index doesn't have to be the id of the "innermost" child node as some of the examples suggest.
    - Only consider element nodes.
    - Only elements that have body as an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) are sliceable.
    - If the id attribute of the start or end index is not in the DOM, return undefined.
    - If the slice is not feasible — there's no path connecting the element at the starting index to the ending index — return undefined.

    //    There are a couple of things worth noting in this problem. First, it is difficult to build the slice of the DOM tree starting from the start since there is the possibility that an element branches off to many child elements. When this happens, you have to check each branch for the existence of the element with the specified end. Working from end is easier, since an element will always have only one Node.parentNode.
    //Another tricky thing here is the scenario wherein a slice is not possible given the combination of start and end. The catch here is to detect when you've already reached the body element and you haven't gotten an element that matches the id attribute of the start. When that happens, it means that the combination isn't possible and sliceTree returns undefined.
