<!-- Write a function that takes two element ids as arguments and swaps the positions of the elements represented by the ids. The function returns true for valid swaps and undefined for invalid. To put the focus on the node swapping functionality, you can assume that nodes will have a value for the id attribute and two arguments will always be provided. Use the following HTML and sample codes to test your output: -->

<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>Node Swap</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div id="1">
    <div id="4"></div>
    <div id="5">
      <div id="6"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="2"></div>
  <div id="3">
    <div id="7"></div>
    <div id="8"></div>
    <div id="9"></div>
  </div>
</body>

<script>
  //INVALID SWAPS:
  // at least one of the id attributes doesn't exist
  nodeSwap(1, 20);//undefined

  // at least one of the nodes is a "child" of the  other
  nodeSwap(1, 4); //undefined
  nodeSwap(9, 3); //undefined

  //valid swap
  nodeSwap(1, 2);

  function nodeSwap(node1Id, node2Id) {
    const node1 = document.getElementById(node1Id);
    const node2 = document.getElementById(node2Id);

    if (!isInvalidSwap(node1, node2)) {
      const node1Clone = node1.cloneNode(true);
      const node2Clone = node2.cloneNode(true);
      const node1Parent = node1.parentNode;
      const node2Parent = node2.parentNode;

      node1Parent.replaceChild(node2Clone, node1);
      node2Parent.replaceChild(node1Clone, node2);
      return true;
    }
  }

  function isInvalidSwap(node1, node2) {
    return ((!node1 || !node2) ||
      node1.contains(node2) || node2.contains(node1));
  }
  //The main challenge presented by this exercise is keeping track of the positions of the nodes so that each node gets swapped in to the appropriate spot. The solution went with the quick route (see further exploration) of creating a clone of the node and its children (by passing in true as an argument) and getting the respective parents of the nodes. The parents of the node are used as the reference point for the position. With the clone and the parents, the solution just swaps in the respective clones for the originals using the Node.replaceChild method. The .replaceChild method takes care of the specific position of the node with respect to the parent node; we just need to be careful to pass in the appropriate clone and original node.
  //The sample runs also suggest the need for guard clauses to check whether the two nodes are swappable. The solution uses the isInvalidSwap helper function to take care of that.
