//events and elements:
- retrieve list (or show list initial)

- add contact button
  - submit
  - cancel



- edit - remove that contact from list if user submits, then add the modified user to contacts list
  - submit
  - cancel

- delete

- search field
  - on each input, use the input value as the new search query, which we should check against each contact to see if the fullname has a matching substring

- tags
  - populate tags lists from contacts lists (use the underscore.js pluck/where methods. Maybe with those methods I didnt need to add the contact to the tags list each time!)
  - display relevant list of filtered contacts when tag is clicked

-- do i need separate ELs for create submit vs edit submit? yes - one will use PUT, the other POST
-- do i need separate ELs for create cancel vs edit cancel? no - both hide form and display list


REFACTOR
- variable for document.querySelector('#underlay_wrapper').style.display
- show create form
- success message (223-226)
- show list, hide initial (266-269 | 324-328 | 366-375). (do we even need to hide initial after the 1st time?)


-need a 'show all contacts' button to avoid dead-end after clicking tag. Can put it next to a title called 'Selected Contacts' whenever someone clicks a tag button. Better than generic 'selected contacts' can put 'marketing contacts', etc. for each one. Need to understnand when to use Handlebars partial...perhaps this is a scenario?

-form validation to prevent empty spaces and non-alphas

--re the tags data structure - either array or string. API docs staes it's a comma-separated string, so whenever i send a request or get one back from API i will be dealing with a string. But to loop through the tags using Handlebars I need an array, right? Any way to loop thru a string using Handlebars? Or a better way to display the tag buttons?

--when user clicks to edit contact, I populated the fields with the previously entered inputs. How do I select the dropdown items that were previously selected? Some way to isolate the tag names from the contact and match them up with the option values. If a match, then pre-select that option.

--CSS animation for the underlay wrapper

--seleting DOM elements at top of App object or in init() method

--re pre-select select options for the previously selected tags - im also not capturing the edited tags when a user makes an edit on the tags


SEARCH AUTOCOMPLETE
- need HTML elements: overlay, list
searc
wrapper
  search
  list
  overlay

valueChanged method
  on each search field INPUT event:
    if input.value > 0
      call helper func fetch matches, which takes a searchquery and cb with param matches:
        - xhr req, where res = matches list. And we call the CB with res as arg
        -  Make list visible by making visible = true(in DRAW func, if visible === false, make over overlay.textContent = '' then return to end draw func)
        - set matches to matches param/arg
        - selectedindex = null
        - bestmatchindex = 0
        - draw list
    else reset list

reset method
draw method
handlekeydown

handleSearch vs valueChanged. Valuechanged uses XHR, handleSearch uses the existing contacts list
