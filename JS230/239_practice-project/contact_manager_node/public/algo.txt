//events and elements:
- retrieve list (or show list initial)

- add contact button
  - submit
  - cancel



- edit - remove that contact from list if user submits, then add the modified user to contacts list
  - submit
  - cancel

- delete

- search field
  - on each input, use the input value as the new search query, which we should check against each contact to see if the fullname has a matching substring

- tags
  - populate tags lists from contacts lists (use the underscore.js pluck/where methods. Maybe with those methods I didnt need to add the contact to the tags list each time!)
  - display relevant list of filtered contacts when tag is clicked

-- do i need separate ELs for create submit vs edit submit? yes - one will use PUT, the other POST
-- do i need separate ELs for create cancel vs edit cancel? no - both hide form and display list
