// 1- Relationships - can i tell how this obj was created? can i tell how it relates to other object?
// 2- Redundancy - Does this help me dry up my code? does this help me save space in memory? - are methods pointing to same object(good) or different object in memory (bad)

//OLOO
//object creation pattern based on creating new objects with Object.create method using prototype objects. Object creation and propertly initialization occur in separate stages (unlike constructor functions invoked with new keyword)
//Because OLOO Pattern does not use constructors, examining inheritance with methods like Object.prototype.constructor/myObj.constructor and instanceof will not work as expected - constructor willreturn Object.prototype (the top element in the prototypal inheritance hierarchy) while instanceof will return error bc it requires right-hand operand to be a function. Instead, isPrototypeOf and Object.getPrototypeOf could be used for such purpose. 
//init is a method used to initialize props in newly created objects inheriting from this prototype - with OLOO, the creation vs initialization of the objects occurs at separate times
//instantiate new object with `Object.create` where the argument passed in is the object prototype for the newly created object assigned to the variable `cloth`.
//OLOO considered delegation pattern (sharing methods) rather than inheritance pattern (sub-types and super-types, constructor functions and prototype prop)

//constructors
//in simple constructor pattern (without prototypes), all methods are also in constructor, not on prototype object. Created object will still have their own copy of methods, but their source can be traced by using constructor property on the instances.
//when a function is invoked with the 'new' keyword, that function becomes a constructor function and the following things happen: 1-5 (create new object, invoke constructor function, set 'this' to refer to new object, set dunder proto of new object to constructor function prototype, return new object)
//prototype prop returns the object we use to share methods. constructor functions set the object prototype for the objects they create to the constructor's prototype object.
// newly created objects share methods defined on the constructor function prototype AKA constructor's prototype prop, meaning the instances dont hold their own copies of these methods but can still use them by delegating method access to that prototype object.

    this.type = type;

// all objects created by the Shirt constructor inherit from Shirt.prototype, and that's where we store the methods we want shared by all shirt objects.

Shirt.prototype = Object.create(Garment.prototype)//not assigning to just supertype.prototype because then the 2 protos will reference the same object in memory and therefore props defined on one will be available to the other. And we'll have a broken proto chain where Dog wont be lowr on chain than Animal + cant determine type by using getPrototypeOf(myObj) since that will return same object
//alternatively can also do:
Shirt.prototype = new Garment()//but this way may come with some extra unnecessary props whereas Object.create doesnt come with this excess baggage
Shirt.prototype.constructor = Shirt // after we reassign Shirt.prototype to a new object that inherits from Garment.prototype, and the contstructor prop of Garment.prototype references Garment, so Shirt.prototype.constructor now points to Garment as well, so we need to reset that constructor prop to point to Shirt.

//PSEUDO-CLASSICAL inheritance vs PROTOTYPAL DELEGATION
//Pseudo-Classical inheritance makes use of constructor functions and the constructor function's prototype property to delegate method access, while prototypal delegation doesn't use constructors and prototypes, rather it uses JavaScript's internal [[Prototype]] property to delegate method access to the object pointed to by [[Prototype]]/dunder proto.

// They are related in that Pseudo-Classical inheritance relies on prototypal delegation to share/delegate method access, since the constructor function's prototype object of a sub-type gets its internal [[Prototype]] property (or its dunder proto property) set to the parent object (the constructor function prototype's of the super-type). So both paradigms set the inheriting object's [[Prototype]]/dunder proto property to a parent object.
